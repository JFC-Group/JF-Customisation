Step 1 :- Create a VPN server (wireguard using pivpn in dietpi os in my case)
Step 2 :- expose device over ipv6 not ipv4(cause of cgnat or pay for public IP)  both inbound and outbound in router firewall page for ipv6
Step 3 :- connect to the VPN using OpenVPN or wireguard depending on the server installation

Any ngork/remote.it or any similar service is required to connect with headless if the ipv6 is getting updated, or a free ddns which for ipv6 is also good

Observation
The main use is to connect to the home network using the VPN, you can use hotstart,aha and other services when you are overseas.

The Jiocall app would register the app, or a new device can be added to everything but the jiocall(last versions after the rename) would sometimes stop working, and call can not be placed.
Detailed analysis is required to check the tvbox and jiotv apk
